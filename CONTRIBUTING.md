# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines to help us maintain a high-quality project.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork** the repository and create your feature branch from `dev` with a meaningful, short name (e.g., `user-auth`, `fix-login-bug`, `docs`).
- **Work** on your changes in your feature branch.
- **Merge** your feature branch into the `dev` branch via pull request once your work is complete.
- **Describe** your changes clearly in your pull request.
- **Reference** any related issues in your PR description.

### Branch Structure

We follow a structured branching approach:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Only stable, tested features are merged here.
- **`dev`**: Development branch where feature branches are merged. Once multiple features work well together, `dev` is merged into `main`.
- **Feature branches**: Individual branches for specific features or fixes, created from `dev`.
